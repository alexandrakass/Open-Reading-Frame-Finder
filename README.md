# Open-Reading-Frame-Finder
This project was created to improve the algorithm for open reading frame finders

This project uses the psudo-code from https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1742-6596/1341/9/092010/pdf to write an open reading frame (ORF) finder in python.
The goal is to create an improved version of previously written ORF algorithms that is more intuitive and easier for a user to understand. 

# Requirements to run this code -
 - IDE that can run python 3.5
 - SeqIO from the Bio Python library
 - FASTA file to test and run the code
 - The path of the directory where the FASTA files are stored
